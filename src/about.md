This exhibition features some of the notable and eclectic works that are part of the collections in the Swarthmore College Libraries Rare Book Room, a number of which were donated to the college by alumni. Among the works are the recently restored *Astronomicum Caesareum* (1540) with its beautiful hand-colored volvelles, a first edition of Mary Wollstonecraft’s *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects* (1792), a very rare first publication of Edgar Allan Poe’s *Murders in the Rue Morgue* (1843), numerous contemporary artists’ books including Ed Ruscha’s iconic *Twentysix Gasoline Stations* (1967), and a signed copy of Toni Morrison’s only known published poetry with artwork by Kara Walker (2002). These works are periodically on display at McCabe Library.

Curated by Susan Dreher and Amy McColl, Curators of the Swarthmore College Book Arts + Private Press Collection, Spring 2021.
